    "An evil warlord has discovered an ancient tunnel (represented as a neural network) connected to your city's sewers. He plans to send deadly tidal waves through it to attack your city! Thankfully, you have a plan. You know there is an even older, prehistoric tunnel (also represented as a neural network) that connects to the city sewers at the point just before the warlord's waves reach the city. Let us call this point the mixing chamber.\n",

Aim to get the energy of the resultant waves (L2 norm of combined neural network output) to be as close to 0 as possible. The warlord will send 5 waves, and his wave patterns are known to you upfront."
